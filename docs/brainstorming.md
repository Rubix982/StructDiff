## Side-by-Side Comparison

- Layout: Place two JSON data sets side by side with scroll synchronization (or independent scrolling for larger files). Each JSON file should be in its own pane or panel.
- Structure Highlighting: Indent the JSON data properly with collapsible sections to show the hierarchy. Expand and collapse buttons for each section of the JSON (objects and arrays).
- Color-Coding: Use color coding to highlight differences:
- Green for added or modified data.
- Red for removed data.
- Yellow for data that has changed (e.g., values are different).
- Interactive Tooltips: When hovering over any part of the JSON, show a tooltip that briefly explains the difference between the two structures or values.
- Buttons/Icons: Provide buttons for quick actions like:
- “Merge” (to combine differences).
- “Toggle Difference View” (for side-by-side or inline comparison).

## Inline Diffing

- Single Pane View: Show both JSON structures in a single column, with inline diffing marking changes directly next to the corresponding line in each file.
- Text Differentiation: Use color-coded highlights to emphasize differences (e.g., red for deleted, green for added, blue for modified).
- Expand/Collapse Nodes: Enable collapsible tree-like structures to avoid overwhelming the user with too much data at once. When collapsed, show the count of differences within each collapsed section.
- Side Buttons: Small buttons next to each diff could allow users to:
- “Accept” or “Reject” changes.
- “Merge” changes into a unified structure.

## Tree Structure View

- Tree-Based Comparison: Display the two JSON files in a tree format with expandable nodes (both key and value pairs) so that users can drill down to the exact key-value pairs that differ.
- Difference Markers: Place visual markers (e.g., icons or colored dots) next to keys and values that have differences between the two JSON files.
- Expand All/Collapse All: Provide buttons to expand or collapse all nodes at once to quickly navigate through large JSON structures.
- Tooltip Details: When hovering over a node, provide a tooltip to show details about the differences (e.g., what exactly changed or was added/removed).

## Diff Summary Panel

- Summary Table: A panel that shows a summary of the differences, grouped by types of changes (added, removed, modified), with the number of changes at each level.
- Filtering Options: Allow users to filter by:
- “Only show changed data.”
- “Only show missing keys.”
- “Only show added keys.”
- Actionable Items: Provide buttons next to each item in the summary to allow users to quickly jump to the section of the JSON where the difference occurred.

## JSON Schema Visualization

- Schema Mapping: If available, display a schema for each JSON object and show how each file matches or deviates from the expected schema.
- Error Highlighting: Highlight any mismatches or missing values based on the schema and allow users to view specific differences in data types or missing required keys.
- Schema Comparison: If two different schemas are used for comparison, show a side-by-side comparison of the schema structures with color-coded indicators for differences.

## Version Control Integration

- Version Tracking: If comparing different versions of JSON, integrate a version history panel where users can select specific versions of the JSON files to compare.
- Change Log: Display a detailed changelog showing what was added, deleted, or modified in each version.
- Rollback Option: Provide an option to roll back to a previous version if the differences are too significant.

## Interactive JSON Editing

- Real-Time Edit and Compare: Allow users to make changes directly within the comparison interface. Changes should reflect immediately in the comparison UI (e.g., when the user changes a value, it immediately shows as modified).
- Merge Tool: Provide an option to merge the two JSONs interactively. Users should be able to choose which changes to accept from each JSON file.
- Undo/Redo: Allow undo and redo actions for changes made during the comparison process.

## Contextual Information Panel

- Contextual Insights: Provide a panel where users can see more context on the differences, including metadata, explanation of why differences exist (e.g., schema conflicts, data type mismatches).
- Help Section: Offer contextual tooltips or a help section explaining how to interpret the comparison results.

## Search and Navigation

- Search Bar: Provide a search bar to quickly locate specific keys or values in both JSONs and highlight differences in real-time as the user types.
- Jump to Differences: Allow the user to jump to a specific difference (e.g., “Next Difference” button) to navigate quickly through the JSON data.

## Download Options

- Export Changes: After completing the comparison, provide the option to download the changes (e.g., as a patch or merged JSON file).
- Download Diff Report: Provide an option to download a detailed report in a structured format (e.g., HTML, CSV, or text) summarizing all the differences.

## Tree Structure Visualization

- Node Representation: Each key-value pair in the JSON will be represented as a node in the tree. If the value is another object or array, it will be a nested node.
- Color-Coding for Differences: Differentiate changes between two JSON files using distinct colors:
- Added Nodes: Highlight with green.
- Removed Nodes: Highlight with red or gray.
- Modified Nodes: Highlight with orange or blue.
- Unchanged Nodes: Default or neutral color.
- Node Shape: Use different node shapes to represent different data types:
- Circle or Square for keys.
- Diamond for arrays or nested objects.

## Expandable and Collapsible Nodes

- Expand/Collapse Buttons: Add buttons (or plus/minus icons) next to each node that allow users to expand or collapse objects or arrays, making it easier to navigate large JSON files.
- Auto-Collapse on Differences: Initially, collapse large JSON sections that don’t have any structural or data differences, so users can focus on the parts that matter.

## Nesting Levels and Indentation

- Indented Levels: Each nested level should be indented visually to represent the depth of nesting in the JSON structure. For example, an array within an object can be represented with deeper indentation to make it clear how deeply nested the data is.
- Hierarchy Lines: Use lines or arrows to connect parent nodes to their child nodes, emphasizing the hierarchical structure and nesting levels.

## Interactive Differences Indicator

- Edge Highlights: Use edges (lines connecting nodes) to indicate changes between the two JSON files. A node that differs in both JSONs will have different edges connecting it to other nodes (e.g., dotted for one JSON and solid for another).
- Difference Symbols: Place small icons or badges on the nodes (e.g., a pencil for modified nodes, a plus for added nodes, and a minus for removed nodes).
- Side-by-Side View: Place two trees side by side (one for each JSON), and highlight differences in real time. This way, a user can easily compare structures, and the differences will be clear as changes are reflected on both sides.

## Customizable Visualization Options

- Toggle Views: Allow users to toggle between views that show:
- Only the differences: Hide identical sections to focus on differences.
- Full Tree View: Show the complete structure with all nodes expanded.
- Filter by Difference Type: Provide filtering options where users can choose to only view nodes that have been added, removed, or modified.

## Node Data Display and Tooltip

- Hover Details: When hovering over a node, show a tooltip with more detailed information about the difference, including the key and the exact data that has changed (for example, if a value has changed from "value1" to "value2").
- Tooltip for Levels: Provide a level indicator that shows the nesting depth of the node when hovered over, so the user can see exactly where the node sits in the hierarchy.

## Edge Styling for Structural Changes

- Difference Edges: When comparing two JSON files, the edges (lines connecting nodes) between nodes that differ could be styled differently:
- Solid for unchanged relations.
- Dashed for modified or changed relations.
- Bold/Colored for added/removed keys.

## Navigation and Interaction

- Clickable Nodes: Make nodes clickable, so users can zoom in on that particular section and reveal more details or take actions like merging, editing, or viewing raw data.
- Breadcrumb Navigation: For deep nesting levels, include a breadcrumb trail at the top that shows the path to the selected node, helping users understand their location in the tree structure.

## Graphical Layout

- Tree Layout (Hierarchical): The tree structure should follow a clear hierarchical layout, where parents are placed above their children. The depth of nesting should create a vertical progression with horizontal edges connecting parent nodes to their children.
- Circular Layout (Optional): For a more compact view, use a circular layout with nodes arranged radially around a central node, which can be useful for visualizing relationships in a compact space.

## Zoom and Pan

- Interactive Zoom: Enable zooming in and out for users to focus on specific sections of the JSON, especially useful when working with large JSON objects.
- Pan Functionality: Allow users to pan through the tree structure to explore deeply nested elements and make comparisons more manageable.

## Comparison Overview Panel

- Summary of Differences: On the side of the visualization, show a high-level summary of the differences in terms of added, removed, or changed keys. This will help users quickly locate sections with the most changes.
- Difference Metrics: Show a numeric summary of the differences at the top or bottom of the view (e.g., “5 nodes added, 3 nodes removed, 12 nodes modified”).

## Merge Capabilities (Optional)

- Interactive Merge Tool: Allow users to select differences and merge them directly in the tree structure, adding flexibility for users who want to consolidate the two JSON files.

# Example of the UI

- Left Panel: Original JSON in a collapsible tree view, with added/removed/modified indicators.
- Right Panel: Updated JSON in a similar collapsible tree view.
- Middle Section: Color-coded and highlighted edges that show the structural and data differences.
